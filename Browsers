A browser works as a client browser.
The browser seeks for the URL,the url contains the scheme,domain name,port..etc.when we request a data in browser it first checks for the url.
The html contains the content,stucture and the urls of the particular web page.

First it gets the hypertext url by get method.
And the request are received from the server.
The server find the file or resources form the system of the particular url.
And the data is send back to the url.
The browser displays the information.
